# Embed Exploit
A regular Embed Exploit using Github Pages to showcase an embed which could've been the demise of someone's server. Made by cheatermen (watchdog).

## Why is this here?
We are reaching out to address an urgent concern regarding legal compliance and the need to take proactive measures to prevent potential misuse of our Discord server. Specifically, we wish to shed light on the importance of mitigating embed exploits, which involve a rapid influx of rich media content in the form of embeds, and aligning these actions with relevant United States Code (U.S.C.) provisions. In light of recent events, we strongly recommend disabling editing links or altogether, embeds to enhance content control and minimize the risk of inappropriate material being shared within the server. The U.S.C. does not specifically address the "Embed Shower" exploit directly, but it aligns with the intent of laws related to obscenity and harmful content distribution.

For example: 18 U.S.C. ยง 1460: This section addresses the distribution of explicit material to minors, highlighting the importance of preventing the rapid sharing of harmful content that could inadvertently reach minors within the server. 
18 U.S.C. ยง 1470: Pertaining to the online transmission of harmful material to minors, disabling embeds aligns with efforts to curb the rapid dissemination of potentially harmful content to underage users.

## And why should I care?

Let's take for a example you're a Discord Server owner. If a concerned user reports potential illegal activities within the server, local and/or federal law enforcement agencies may launch an investigation. This involves:

1. Evidence Collection: Authorities may gather evidence from the server and associated online platforms to assess the nature and extent of the alleged violations.
 
2. Interviews and Interrogations: Relevant parties, including administrators and users, may be interviewed to ascertain facts and determine the scope of the issues.
 
3. Legal Action: If violations are confirmed, law enforcement may pursue legal action, which could range from issuing warnings and cease-and-desist orders to conducting raids and making arrests.

And if your server is found to be in violation of federal and state laws, several legal consequences may follow:

1. Criminal Charges: Violation of laws related to child exploitation, obscenity, or other illicit activities may lead to criminal charges against the individuals involved, including server administrators and users.

2. Fines and Penalties: Offenders may face significant fines, penalties, or financial repercussions depending on the severity of the violations and applicable laws.

3. Imprisonment: Convictions for serious offenses can result in imprisonment for varying durations, depending on the gravity of the violations.

**So disable embeds/disable link editing! It isn't good for your server!**
